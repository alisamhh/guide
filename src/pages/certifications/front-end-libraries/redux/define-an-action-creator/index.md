## Define an Action Creator

There are two parts to this challenge.

1. Declare a `actionCreator()` function.
2. Return the `action` object when that function is called.

### Step 1. Declare a function.

```javascript
const yourFunctionName = () => {}
```

### Step 2. Assign your variable to a method.

```javascript
const yourFunctionName = () => {
  return yourObjectName;
}
```

Good luck!
